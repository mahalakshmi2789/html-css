    <P>We are providing delicious foods in all styles.Indian foos are very spicy as well as delicious. <br>A restaurant (sometimes known as a diner) is a place where cooked food is sold to the public, and where people sit down to eat it. <br>It is also a place where people go to enjoy the time and to eat a meal.</P>
